## Tutorials

This tutorial offers a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for utilizing and developing algorithms that enable quick path replanning during robot trajectory execution. 

`replanners_managers_lib` relies on the [`replanners_lib`](https://github.com/JRL-CARI-CNR-UNIBS/replanners_lib) and [`trajectories_processors_lib`](https://github.com/JRL-CARI-CNR-UNIBS/trajectories_processors_lib). Be sure to check out their documentation and tutorials for more detailed information.
